        <h1 className='font-antonio text-4xl mb-7'>Dear Ema,</h1>
        <p className='text-xl mb-5'>I can’t believe we are already together for a year, the time flies so fast and I’m glad I’m spending that time with you, because ever since you’ve came to my life there was not many times I was sad because you were always there to cheer me up, to be there for me and you’ve always understood what I’m going through and I love you so much because of that.</p>
        <p className='text-xl mb-5'>Now I can’t imagine my life without you, even when I have those silly thoughts that all this is meaningless than we are going to die and then nothing, I know I will live a good life with you and we gonna love each other no matter what. I always knew there was something about you even after first few letters on Slowly that you might be something special for me and I’m glad I was right after all and that I was stupid enough to keep trying to make something special with you.</p>
        <p className='text-xl mb-5'>There are many things we need to figure out still but I like our conversation whenever we have a debate or something we come up with a solution and it’s getting better and better. Now that I think about it how I would be miserable if I ended up with anyone except you because with you I have that special feeling that we will always find a way if we encounter some kind of problem so I don’t worry that our future might be in danger or that we will ever break up, but I still don’t want you to give your life to one person or any person in general because what I’ve found that you need to cherish the relationship with yourself in order to be happy.</p>
        <p className='text-xl mb-5'> I really love travelling with you and I hope we will see every place we ever wanted to see because when I’m with you on a trip it’s like being on the sea but even better because I’m so peaceful I see many amazing things and I fully reset my brain for upcoming problems I need to focus on. I still remember a year ago when I travelled to Zlatar Bistrica to meet you I wasn’t nervous at all I had a feeling that everything is going to be alright and things will workout for us when we are in a quiet place when we can talk about anything to each other.</p>
        <p className='text-xl mb-5'>Now I wish I could have spent more time on this project but you know I'm quite busy this days but I did my best I know the design is not the best and you would change font maybe but that's the way I wanted it to look for you a little bit retro, also I'm using Tailwind css for the first time and it's hard to style some things so keep that in mind. </p>
        <p className='text-xl mb-5'>Lastly I know you are not a fan of love songs but I always said I will play this to my girlfriend when I truely love her so I really want you to listen to Bryan Adams Everything I do, Elvis Presley Can't stop falling in love (I know you don't like him either but this is a good one).</p>
